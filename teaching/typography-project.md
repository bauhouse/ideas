# Typography Project

## This class is a design agency

You have four months to create a project that you will publish. If you want to make this real, you can decide to publish the design electronically. If you are able to crowdfund the printing costs, work with the printer to prepare the publication for press, and successfully print it, everyone gets an A, as long as they can prove that they were a valuable team player. This will be decided on by the team (25%), by your own report on your contribution (50%), and by me (25%). It will be like a cooperative version of Survivor. This project will represent 70% of your grade.

As a design studio and publishing house, you need to figure out what you can accomplish. I would suggest that you start by talking with each other about the roles that you will play. Find a design studio you admire and look at their team page. Each of you need to determine what your job title will be depending on what your strengths are. If you like, I can be the interviewer and HR Manager, to use my knowledge and experience to gauge the best fit for each role. Or if there is someone who likes the idea of playing HR Manager, I would be glad to relinquish the role.

Typography is a technology that gives you tremendous power if you are able to wield words effectively. This is part content, part presentation.

John Hudson said over beer after a recent Type Brigade meetup, Typography follows empires (and churches, he added).

Who were the ones who wielded words through history, before mass production, before consumerism, before advertising, before capitalism, before democracy?

Kings, priests, scribes, judges, lawyers, merchants, poets, song writers, philosophers, scientists.

However, something very interesting is happening in your lifetime: the democratization of the means of production and the media. Everyone has a voice.

But if everyone has a voice, no one has a voice (Incredibles).

But it is also about the weaponizing of automation and artificial intelligence as a way to disrupt the status quo and shift the balance of power.

What is the best way to be heard if everyone is shouting?

Collectively, your voice is stronger if you are speaking in unison.

So what do you want to say to the people in power? You have had to jump through hoops all your life to get to this point. For many of you, there is one more hoop to jump through before you can achieve complete independence and consider yourself an adult: college graduation.

What is the most important thing that this world needs to hear? As a team, how are you going to decide? If you could change the world in some way, what would you do to make it better? If there are systemic problems that need to be changed, what would you do to be a catalyst, a change agent? You have the power of typography in your hands.

According to Marty Neumeier, design is the gap between vision and reality. You have a vision of how the world could be better. Design is the application of the scientific method to the process of creativity. The design artefact is not the product. The real artefact is the result: to know truth, to create beauty, and to do good.

Watch The Human Scale to understand the scope of the problems that your generation needs to solve. My generation failed, but we helped raise awareness of the systemic issues, although we are still struggling to figure out how to turn the Titanic away from disaster.

Consider Long Now, The Third Industrial Revolution, Buckminster Fuller Institute, Web Foundation, IDEO.org, GOOD.is, Project Drawdown, #TimeIsUp.

As a designer, as Chief Design Officer of the agency, I have some ideas. But my time is limited. I’m only here once a week for a few hours. You need to come up with a plan and decide what questions to ask me so you can reach your goal.

What are you going to do? Welcome to the game of life.

At the beginning of each class, I will spend a half hour discussing a topic regarding how to understand good typography. We will go through an exercise to test how well you have understood the concepts by putting your new knowledge into practice. Over 10 weeks, there will be 10 exercises, each representing 3% of your grade, for a total of 30%.

By the end of the term, you will have designed your own business cards and stationery, to brand yourself. You will also work together to design your agency business cards and stationery. The final project will be the collaborative project of your own choosing and design. And that challenge begins ... now.

I will leave, and come back in 15 minutes. When I come back, I want to discover if you have what it takes to become a learning organization. Google the concept if you like.

I’ll see you in 15 minutes.
